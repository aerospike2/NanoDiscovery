This repository provides all of the software and harware build files and instructions necessary for creating your own version of a Modular Wheel Platform (MWP).  
The MWP is multi-reaction dispensing station, enabling a far higher reaction throughput compared to conventional benchwork. With this system, multiple reactions can be conducted simultaneously with minimal downtime - determined by dispensing rate and wheel size. The system can incorporate several different types of attachable modules for probe analysis, reaction-reaction transfer and sample extraction. Stand alone modules for heating/stirring, filtration and storage are also included in this repository.
