dipole_list.csv (name changed), atomList_Octahedron.csv and coordNumList_Octahedron.csv are generated through Nanoparticle_Generator.nb. 
They represent the atomic model for FCC octahedron with an edge length of 20 nm and lattice constant of 0.41 nm.
Then we generated a core-shell structure by setting all the atoms as Ag first, and then change the atoms in the core to be Au later.


The atomic model for the Au core is generated by Nanoparticle_Generator_core.nb for exp1 to exp6, with the edge length from 20 nm to 10 nm.
The lattice constant is consistent with the one above (0.41 nm) and the edge length interval is 2 nm from exp1 to exp6.
